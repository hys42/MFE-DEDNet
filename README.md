MFE-DEDNet

Multi-dimensional Feature Extraction based Deep Encoder-Decoder Network for Automatic Surface Defect Detection

Abstract 
The control of surface defects is of critical importance in manufacturing quality control systems. Today, automatic defects detection using imaging and deep learning algorithms has produced more successful results than manual inspections. Thanks to these automatic applications, manufacturing systems will increase the production quality, and thus financial losses will be prevented. However, since the appearance and dimensions of the defects on the surface are very variable, automatic surface defect detection is a complex problem. In addition, very few surface defect images in the data sets are available to use in the training of deep models. This situation creates an insufficiency for training deep learning architectures containing millions of parameters. In this study, Multi-dimensional Feature Extraction based Deep Encoder-Decoder Network (MFE-DEDNet) network developed to solve such problems.
